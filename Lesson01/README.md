## What is a level?

The goal is to direct the elephant to collect all the coins and reach the target (purple flag). Try doing it with using as few commands as possible!

## What commands can I use?

- `move()` - Moves the elephant one field forward in the direction he's facing.
- `turnRight()` - Turns the elephant by 90° to the right.
- `turnLeft()` - Turns the elephant by 90° to the left.
- More to come...

You can use any other javascript code. So feel free to use loops, variables etc.
